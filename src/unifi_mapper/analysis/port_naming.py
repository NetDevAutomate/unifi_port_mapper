"""Derive durable switch port labels from live LLDP and wired-client data.

Why this exists
---------------
Port labels drift. On 2026-08-03 an audit found `Office USW Ultra 210W` ports 1-7 still
reading the factory default ``PoE Out + Data`` when they were seven named access points,
and `Lounge USW Flex 2.5G 8 PoE` p1/p2 had their two downstream switches transposed. Stale
labels are worse than absent ones: two diagnoses during that session were wrong because a
port label was trusted as evidence (a "faulty" camera link was really a switch uplink, and
a "100 Mbps Raspberry Pi" was really a JetKVM).

The existing ``discover`` path resolves an LLDP peer from ``system_name``, which UniFi APs
do not send. It therefore fell back to keeping the stale label. This module resolves the
LLDP ``chassis_id`` against the adopted-device registry instead, which is what recovers
those AP names.

Naming precedence
-----------------
1. LLDP peer that resolves to an adopted UniFi device -> its name, plus the remote port
   when the peer reports a usable port id (a MAC is not usable).
2. Exactly one wired client on the port -> that client's name.
3. Several wired clients (a downstream unmanaged switch) -> ``<best name> +N``.
4. Otherwise leave the label alone.

Guards
------
Four failure modes were observed while building the plan against a live estate, each of
which loses information or churns pointlessly:

* ``would_lose_information`` - a client that momentarily reports no hostname would rename
  ``Google Streamer 4K`` to ``b4:23:a2:af:9b:3f``.
* ``name_quality`` - a raw MAC sorts first alphabetically, so a multi-client port labelled
  ``Office-Apple-TV`` would become ``42:ed:cf:6f:ff:35 +2``.
* ``is_cosmetic_change`` - ``AI-Port`` -> ``AI Port`` is pure churn.
* ``strip_multi_suffix`` - a device that comes and goes makes the ``+N`` counter oscillate
  between runs forever.
