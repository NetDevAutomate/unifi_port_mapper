"""Tests for the 5GHz channel plan applied by `scripts/apply_ap_channel_plan.py`.

The script is an operator tool that mutates live radio configuration, so the
plan data itself is the thing worth testing: a self-colliding plan silently
produces the contention the script exists to remove.

Found by review on 2026-08-27: the plan assigned `Reece U6-Pro` primary 157 at
40MHz and `U6 LR` primary 161 at 40MHz. In UNII-3 the 40MHz bonded pairs are
149+153 and 157+161, so both primaries resolve to the SAME 157+161 block - two
APs on identical spectrum.

`scripts/` is not an importable package, so the module is loaded by path.
